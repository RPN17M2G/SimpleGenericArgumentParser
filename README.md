# Simple and Generic Argument Parser - SGAP
This is a small project that has a simple and all-purpose argument parser. It can handle three types of input values: text, numbers (you can use decimal or hexadecimal base), and boolean values. 
The data about the flags is set up using a CSV file.

added option for some flags to require a certing flag inorder to work(I called it "s" for example).

added python tests

helper files:
command.txt - Includes the command used to compile the project(32bit compilation) and a demonstration of the parser.

flags.csv - Includes the data on all the different flags.
